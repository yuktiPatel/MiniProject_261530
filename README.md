## Challanges faced and how it was overcome

| No. | Challange | Solution |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1. | Have implemented binary and hexadecimal using char but it was using extra memory and also have to build another functions for them | So I have implemented them using integer and have added check conditions to check the input |
